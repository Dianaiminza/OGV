It was a very taxing but worthwhile journey; After almost a year of introspection, research, sweat and tears, we couldn\u2019t be prouder of the final product. Nothing could have prepared us for the overwhelmingly positive feedback from our customers and supporters. That has made it truly worth it.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"a657\" class=\"iw ix ft av iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk jl jm jn jo jp jq jr js jt gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"by\">The Start<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p id=\"eda1\" class=\"hy hz ft ia b ib ju id ie if jv ih ii ij jw il im in jx ip iq ir jy it iu iv dh gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">ReelFruit\u2019s journey has never<span id=\"rmm\">\u00a0<\/span>been easy. From the company\u2019s inception, we\u2019ve always been fighting an uphill battle on several fronts: Introducing new products into the market people had never known before, trying to get our distribution right when no one wanted to distribute \u201cnew products\u201d on our behalf, trying to scale a \u201cpremium\u201d product\u2026you name it, we faced it. We had to pick our battles, and packaging was not one we could fight consistently. To get brand uniformity is not just a time consuming process, it is also very expensive. You have to spend on packaging design, printing all new packaging at once, and writing off old packaging material. It is a huge capital outlay that we couldn\u2019t afford till now.<\/p>\n<p id=\"11f2\" class=\"hy hz ft ia b ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv dh gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As you can see below, our packaging design\u2026umm progressively deteriorated (to put it mildly) as we chose launching and distributing new products in the market as quickly as possible over brand uniformity. In summary, we didn\u2019t have the time \u2014 nor finances \u2014 to make the investment in brand uniformity.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"ka kb kc kd ke hl fb fc paragraph-image\">\n<div class=\"fb fc jz\">\n<div class=\"hr s ah hs\">\n<div class=\"kf hu s\">\n<div class=\"eq hm fj et ep hn w ho hp hq\">\u00a0<\/div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tk ub fj et ep hn w c aligncenter\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/476\/1*s2v2ZJvrqbOm7MjcLpS03Q.png\" sizes=\"476px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/276\/1*s2v2ZJvrqbOm7MjcLpS03Q.png 276w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/476\/1*s2v2ZJvrqbOm7MjcLpS03Q.png 476w\" alt=\"\" width=\"476\" height=\"184\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"kg kh fd fb fc ki kj av b aw ax bt\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We are thankful to our customers who focused on loving what was \u2018inside\u2019 vs judging a book by its cover\ud83d\ude0a<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p id=\"3552\" class=\"hy hz ft ia b ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv dh gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"ia cu\">The Process<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"7026\" class=\"hy hz ft ia b ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv dh gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">After deciding to re-brand, we realized that a simple brand refresh wasn\u2019t going to be enough. We had come to a point in our journey where we needed to rethink on our mission, vision, culture and our core values and reflect that in our new brand identity. We went through a process of workshops, culture surveys, focus groups to finalize and agree on who we are and what we stand for. We then decided to reflect this in our new brand identity, which was brought to life so beautifully in the most comprehensive brand book prepared for us by our brand agency,\u00a0<a class=\"dn kk\" href=\"http:\/\/www.evokelagos.com\/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Evoke Lagos<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"aa88\" class=\"hy hz ft ia b ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv dh gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We\u2019ve come a long way since 2012, both literally and figuratively. We\u2019ve learned a lot along and have come into our own as a company with a clear mission and on a unique journey. We can\u2019t share every detail in this article but here are the main reasons we decided to rebrand:<\/p>\n<p id=\"f3cb\" class=\"hy hz ft ia b ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv dh gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"ia cu\">We were very dissatisfied with our visual identity.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"fa45\" class=\"hy hz ft ia b ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv dh gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We felt our former packaging had become dated and unrepresentative of the caliber of company we are building. Not only was it very scattered, our once \u2018innovative\u2019 packaging had now become obsolete and boring. It was clear we needed to do something visual to maintain our position in the market.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"ka kb kc kd ke hl fb fc paragraph-image\">\n<div class=\"fb fc kl\">\n<div class=\"hr s ah hs\">\n<div class=\"km hu s\">\n<div class=\"eq hm fj et ep hn w ho hp hq\">\u00a0<\/div>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tk ub fj et ep hn w c aligncenter\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/624\/1*otV6j9EI7B0Qnjrpv7U3jw.png\" sizes=\"624px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/276\/1*otV6j9EI7B0Qnjrpv7U3jw.png 276w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/552\/1*otV6j9EI7B0Qnjrpv7U3jw.png 552w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/624\/1*otV6j9EI7B0Qnjrpv7U3jw.png 624w\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"211\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<figure class=\"ka kb kc kd ke hl fb fc paragraph-image\">\n<div class=\"ko kp ah kq w kr\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">\n<div class=\"fb fc kn\">\n<div class=\"hr s ah hs\">\n<div class=\"ks hu s\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"tk ub fj et ep hn w c aligncenter\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/1000\/1*Teullnem9qqP0Zs5SUheEQ.jpeg\" sizes=\"700px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/276\/1*Teullnem9qqP0Zs5SUheEQ.jpeg 276w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/552\/1*Teullnem9qqP0Zs5SUheEQ.jpeg 552w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/640\/1*Teullnem9qqP0Zs5SUheEQ.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/miro.medium.com\/max\/700\/1*Teullnem9qqP0Zs5SUheEQ.jpeg 700w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"339\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p id=\"2759\" class=\"hy hz ft ia b ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv dh gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"ia cu\">We wanted to unify our packaging<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"a52b\" class=\"hy hz ft ia b ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv dh gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We realized that for the sake of brand consistency and trust, we needed to unify our packaging identity. Many customers were not aware of our full range because every product looked different from the other. Today, we have 16 SKUs, sold in over 350 stores nationwide. At a glance, our range was in no way uniform, which caused a shelving nightmare in stores.<\/p>\n<p id=\"8744\" class=\"hy hz ft ia b ib ic id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv dh gp\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The more we grew and expanded into new regions, it became abundantly clear that this was necessary.
