We explore what we\u2019ve seen in the mango value chain and how we plan to use industry to pull up the fruit value chain.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In 2018, 34-year old Muhktar Adamu planted 1,000 mango trees on his family farm in Barakallahu, a village 10 km from Kaduna in northern Nigeria. He took over the orchard from his father who forayed into growing \u201cthe king of fruits\u201d 15 years earlier.<\/p>\n<p>In the four years it takes for mangoes to begin fruiting, Adamu did what he thought was right for his fledgling trees. He invited a farm specialist when a disease broke out in the orchard. He applied herbicides and pesticides, admittedly on a trial and error basis. And, he sought advice from a friend in Ghana, renowned for its thriving mango sector.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_16541\" style=\"width: 331px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-16541\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-16541\" src=\"https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Screenshot-2021-12-07-091639-226x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"321\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Screenshot-2021-12-07-091639-226x300.png 226w, https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Screenshot-2021-12-07-091639.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-16541\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Muhktar Adamu<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Fast forward four years. One April morning, in the early days of the mango season, Adamu woke up to a harsh reality: only 10 of his 1,000 trees had produced fruit. A meager 1%.<\/p>\n<p>Devastating losses like Adamu\u2019s have a catastrophic impact on Nigeria\u2019s mango sector. Without a steady mango supply, processors tend to stay away.<\/p>\n<p>Most small and medium agri businesses, like ours, rely on small farmers like Adamu. In an ideal world, agri processors would plant their own orchards to secure their raw materials. While this is a less risky approach, orchards are eye-wateringly expensive to develop and maintain. They require massive investment. Given the length of time before mango orchards produce fruit and can mint money, investors aren\u2019t keen to back commercial fruit farms. They aren\u2019t clamoring to sink their capital &#8211; literally &#8211; into the ground for years.<\/p>\n<p>[Side note: we still plan to grow 40% of our fruit supply but it\u2019s a part of our long-term strategic plans. We\u2019ve had <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@marketsandmangoes\">our past misadventures in mango farming<\/a>, which taught us a lot and made us rethink our supply chain strategy.]<\/p>\n<p>Nigeria\u2019s mango farming is beset with a chicken vs the egg problem.<\/p>\n<p>Processors nix plans to enter the market due to supply issues. Yet, farmers won\u2019t farm mangoes of a certain caliber and quantity if there are no buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Facing only middle men and inconsistent demand, small mango farmers have bleak prospects to forge a prosperous future.<\/p>\n<h3>The sorry state of Nigeria\u2019s mangoes<\/h3>\n<p>Nigeria\u2019s mango farming has fallen into a sorry state. Over decades, serious buyers, like processors of fresh cut or dry fruit as well as juice manufacturers, have quietly closed up shop, leaving farmers without a market.<\/p>\n<p>In turn, smallholder farmers can\u2019t justify investing the time or money into a risky venture like cultivating mangoes.<\/p>\n<p>This has resulted in a mango sector has stagnated, with old trees, old varieties and low bearing fruit.<\/p>\n<p>In the absence of reliable statistics, it is tricky to estimate the number of mango farmers across Nigeria. But, over the years, we\u2019ve crisscrossed the country from Benue to Kaduna to Niger States to assess the mango crop. We\u2019d wager there are roughly 500 mango farmers across Nigeria.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a tiny number.<\/p>\n<p>Since mango farming is still an informal affair, record keeping is abysmal. Most farm managers keep records in their heads. Without written records, mango farmers can\u2019t track the orchard\u2019s history: its year-on-year production, flowering and fruiting times, or fertilizer application.<\/p>\n<p>Not to mention if the farm manager passes away, the records go with him. On our last upcountry trip in July, we visited a farm where the farm manager had recently died. No one could answer our questions because the intimate knowledge of the orchard went with him to the grave.<\/p>\n<p>This snowballs into a host of other problems.<\/p>\n<p>Without accurate records, farmers don\u2019t know when the trees reach maturity. Instead, they rely on <i>nta go gi<\/i>, intuition, to pick the fruits. They turn out to be either unripe or too mature.\u00a0 For us, that\u2019s a problem because it reduces the yield of high-quality fruit for processing.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_16547\" style=\"width: 566px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-16547\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-16547\" src=\"https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/IMG_6719-300x164.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/IMG_6719-300x164.jpg 300w, https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/IMG_6719-700x383.jpg 700w, https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/IMG_6719-600x328.jpg 600w, https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/IMG_6719.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-16547\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An over grown Mango tree in Kaduna<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In addition to record keeping, mango farmers do not know how to prune their trees. Without regular trimming of foliage, mango trees can tower up to 10m, almost five times their ideal 2.5m height to ensure optimal productivity. This creates a ripple effect at harvesting. Farmers do not pluck the fruit off trees once ripened. Rather they let them fall. Since the ripe mangoes drop from such a vertiginous height, they become severely bruised. That further reduces the yield of fruit we can dry and process for our snacks.<\/p>\n<p>Inputs are also a problem area.<\/p>\n<p>Farmers don\u2019t have access to high quality and expensive inputs &#8211; fertilizers and pesticides.<\/p>\n<p>Fertilizers are also a huge problem. Most small mango farmers use cow dung on their mango trees. This natural fertilizer might get the job done for other crops, but it\u2019s a disaster for mango. The high nitrogen levels &#8211; from the cows\u2019 grass diet &#8211; has a curious effect: the tree grows bigger, the foliage gets thicker, but the fruit isn\u2019t sweet. A sour mango is not viable for processors.<\/p>\n<p>The high quality inputs are half the battle. Mango farmers lack knowledge on controlling pests and disease. They try trial and error tactics to manage outbreaks which aren\u2019t that effective.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, the common mango varieties in Nigeria are mostly untraceable and present peculiar processing challenges. Ogbomoso and Sheri mangoes, dotting the Nigerian countryside, have massive seeds and scanty flesh. The fruit is fibrous and stringy. This variety needs a lot of time and effort to peel and cut for drying but yields little output. High-quality varieties like Keitt and Kent mangoes are rare across the country.<\/p>\n<h3>Ghana gives a glimpse of a new future for Nigeria\u2019s mangoes<\/h3>\n<p>Nigeria\u2019s mango sector doesn\u2019t have to look far for inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana is proof that a struggling mango sector can be transformed.<\/p>\n<p>Two decades ago, European fruit companies, Blue Skies and HPW, came to buy pineapples in Ghana. Once there, they scratched their heads and thought: what else can we buy?<\/p>\n<p>Given that global demand for the king of fruits &#8211; so called for its high nutritional value and sweet flesh &#8211; was growing at 20-30% per year, mangoes were a no brainer.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_16530\" style=\"width: 481px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-16530\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-16530\" src=\"https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/csm_Mango-Farmer-Westafriga_HPW_Fresh_Dry_86116fb40d-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"471\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/csm_Mango-Farmer-Westafriga_HPW_Fresh_Dry_86116fb40d-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/csm_Mango-Farmer-Westafriga_HPW_Fresh_Dry_86116fb40d-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/csm_Mango-Farmer-Westafriga_HPW_Fresh_Dry_86116fb40d-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/csm_Mango-Farmer-Westafriga_HPW_Fresh_Dry_86116fb40d-700x467.jpg 700w, https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/csm_Mango-Farmer-Westafriga_HPW_Fresh_Dry_86116fb40d-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/reelfruit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/csm_Mango-Farmer-Westafriga_HPW_Fresh_Dry_86116fb40d.jpg 1270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-16530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">HPW Mango Farm. Photo credit: HPW<\/p><\/div>\n<p>With Blue Skies and HPW snapping up mangos across the country, Ghanaians soon flocked to the sector. Farmers invested time and resources into planting mangoes, as it was no longer a risky cash crop. In turn, buyers supported farmers with comprehensive agro-extension programs.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward twenty years. Mango farming is highly profitable in Ghana. From back of the envelope estimates, one hectare of mango with 200 trees generates $9,400 in total revenue. After 30% costs, farmers can earn $6,500 in profit.<\/p>\n<p>Ghana\u2019s mango sector is thriving. Ghana\u2019s smallholder mango farmers have now risen to 6,000 and the country produces 55,000 MT of mangos per year.<\/p>\n<p>Agro-extension programs were essential to transforming Ghana\u2019s mango sector.
